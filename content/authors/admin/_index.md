My current and past research spans from the Arctic to the Antarctic, and I am most interested in interdisciplenary studies incorporating models and observations, to understand the impacts of climate change on polar regions. I also dabbled in fluvial geomorphology and experimental cosmology before arriving in oceanography.

When I'm not sitting in front of a computer, I'm probably somewhere outside and when I'm lucky in the mountains.
