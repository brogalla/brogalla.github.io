title: Tracing runoff and Atlantic water in the Inuit Nunangat ocean
summary: Identified glacial and continental runoff influence on the composition of water that transits through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago using a manganese (Mn) model. Studied the extension of Atlantic water from Davis Strait into Baffin Bay and the Archipelago using a Pb model.
