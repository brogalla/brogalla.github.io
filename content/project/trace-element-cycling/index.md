Despite their small concentrations, trace elements can be essential micronutrients, harmful pollutants, and can “trace” oceanic processes [Bruland et al., 2013]. Micronutrients such as iron (Fe), Mn, zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) help support photosynthesis and respiration in the ocean and their abundance can control primary productivity, nitrogen and carbon fixation, and phytoplankton community composition [Anderson, 2020]. Pollutants such as mercury (Hg) and Pb are enriched in the ocean by human activity and can be harmful in high concentrations [Boyle et al., 2014, Lamborg et al., 2014]. “Tracers” such as iodine-129 (129 I), aluminium (Al), and some of the micronutrients and pollutants described above can be used as tools to study the movement of water masses, as well as the sources, sinks, and processes that (re)distribute biogeochemical constituents in the ocean [Karcher et al., 2012].

Over the last few decades, the capacity to measure the concentrations of trace elements in the ocean has expanded through technological advances, global campaigns, and regional campaigns targeted at under-sampled regions like the Arctic Ocean (Fig. 1.1). The field of trace element oceanography became established in the 1970s as the development of clean-sampling protocols resolved previous contamination issues [Anderson, 2020, Schaule and Patterson, 1981] and allowed initial surveys in many of the world's ocean basins. Over the next decades, programmes such as the World Ocean Circulation Experiment of tracers and the Scientific Committee for Ocean Research (SCOR)'s Joint Global Ocean Flux Study of carbon further developed knowledge of global circulation patterns, biogeochemical cycling, and atmosphere-ocean coupling. Yet, there remained geographical gaps in trace element measurements which made it difficult to address linkages with global biogeochemical cycles. Starting in the late 2000s, the international GEOTRACES programme aimed to address this problem with a systematic global study of trace elements and their isotopes [SCOR Working Group, 2007].

The multidisciplinary GEOTRACES programme has increased the number of ocean trace element observations by orders of magnitude, transforming our understanding of the ocean's biogeochemical cycling and distributions of trace elements [Anderson, 2020]. Data collection started in the 2010s with legs in all major ocean basins including cruises in the central Arctic Ocean and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (cruise sections GN01-05, GIPY 11, 13-14). Concurrent to the increase in trace element observations, computational capacity improved with increased model resolution, more sophisticated representations of processes, and improved numerical techniques, allowing biogeochemical models to become increasingly prevalent in oceanography. The first generation of ocean biogeochemical models appeared in the late 1990s and early 2000s [Fennel et al., 2022, and references therein]. These models focused on carbon, nutrients like nitrogen and phosphate, and trace elements like iron, protactinium, thorium, and neodymium. The GEOTRACES datasets have allowed the next generation of trace element modelling studies to investigate the key drivers of trace element distributions.
